# Auto-unlock the Bitwarden CLI service-account vault at container startup.
# Captures the unlocked session token and exports it as BW_SESSION so all
# child processes (cloudcli, every Claude shell it spawns) inherit it and
# can call `bw` without asking for credentials.
#
# Designed to FAIL OPEN: if any Vaultwarden creds are missing or wrong,
# log a friendly message and start cloudcli normally — image must remain
# usable when the service account isn't configured yet.
#
# Required env (set via docker-compose from .env):
#   BW_CLIENTID      — service account API client ID (Vaultwarden Settings → Security → API Key)
#   BW_CLIENTSECRET  — service account API client secret (same place)
#   BW_PASSWORD      — service account master password (used only to derive session, then scrubbed)
#
# After successful init, child processes inherit BW_SESSION (and ONLY that —
# the master password is unset before exec'ing the original CMD).
